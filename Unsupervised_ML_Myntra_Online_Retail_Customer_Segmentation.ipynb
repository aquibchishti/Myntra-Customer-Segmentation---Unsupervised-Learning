        "This project focuses on analyzing the international online retail sales of a company, with a specific emphasis on customer behavior and sales patterns.

        "### Machine Learning & Customer Segmentation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Unsupervised machine learning** was applied to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors. Three different models were tested, and after **hyperparameter tuning**, **K-Means clustering** with 3 clusters emerged as the best-performing model. The model utilized **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** values, which are essential indicators of customer activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The K-Means clustering identified the following customer segments:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cluster 0: High-Value, Recently Active Customers**  \n",
        "   - **Recency**: 45.5 (moderately recent)  \n",
        "   - **Frequency**: 57.94 (moderate frequency of purchases)  \n",
        "   - **Monetary**: 975.72 (moderate spending)  \n",
        "   - *Interpretation*: This group consists of mid-tier loyal customers who are moderately active but are close to becoming high-value customers. These customers are prime candidates for **targeted retention strategies** such as personalized offers or loyalty programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cluster 1: Low-Activity, Low-Spend Customers**  \n",
        "   - **Recency**: 248.07 (longer time since last purchase)  \n",
        "   - **Frequency**: 25.29 (low frequency of purchases)  \n",
        "   - **Monetary**: 429.54 (low spending)  \n",
        "   - *Interpretation*: This segment represents customers with low engagement and spending. They may be dormant customers who require **re-engagement campaigns**, special offers, or personalized promotions to rekindle their interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cluster 2: High-Value, Highly Frequent, Recently Active Customers**  \n",
        "   - **Recency**: 23.03 (very recent)  \n",
        "   - **Frequency**: 279.54 (extremely high frequency of purchases)  \n",
        "   - **Monetary**: 5021.01 (exceptionally high spend)  \n",
        "   - *Interpretation*: These customers are the top spenders and frequent buyers, representing the most loyal and valuable group. This segment should be targeted with **exclusive offers**, **VIP loyalty programs**, and **personalized experiences** to further solidify their loyalty and increase their lifetime value.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was conducted to uncover key trends and insights related to sales, customer behavior, and geographic performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Seasonality and Timing Insights**:\n",
        "   - Sales exhibit a **positive upward trend** with noticeable **winter seasonality** from August to December, highlighting a period of increased demand.  \n",
        "   - **Peak sales days**: Thursday and Tuesday, with peak sales hours between **12-2 PM**.  \n",
        "   - This information aids in **optimizing inventory management** and **workforce allocation** to meet increased demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Geographic Insights**:\n",
        "   - The **United Kingdom** dominates sales in terms of numbers, while the **United States** and **Canada** show a broader geographic reach.  \n",
        "   - **Saudi Arabia**, **Bahrain**, and **Czech Republic** show weaker sales, suggesting a need to revisit marketing strategies in these regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Customer Insights**:\n",
        "   - A small number of **loyal customers** account for a significant portion of total sales.  \n",
        "   - Larger transactions are correlated with **lower unit prices**, indicating the potential for **volume discounts** or **bundled offers** to encourage larger purchases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
        "   - Significant **price sensitivity** was found across key countries (United Kingdom, Netherlands, EIRE).  \n",
        "   - It was confirmed that **larger purchases result in lower unit prices**, reinforcing the potential for **bulk sales promotions**.  \n",
        "   - The hypothesis that **spending is higher at the beginning of the month** was not supported, suggesting more **consistent spending patterns** throughout the month.\n",

This highlights a critical period for **marketing** and **inventory strategies** to meet increased demand. Thursday and Tuesday are identified as the busiest days for sales, and the peak hours are between **12-2 PM**, which can aid in optimizing **workforce allocation** and **stock management**. There is a decline in sales as the week progresses, with **Saturday** showing lower activity.
